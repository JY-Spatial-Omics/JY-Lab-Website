### Principal Investigator & Laboratory Director

Dr. Joe Yeong Poh Sheng is listed as World Top 2% scientist since 2024, he is currently a Principal Investigator in the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB, A*STAR) as well as in the Department of Anatomical Pathology, Singapore General Hospital. He has underwent multidisciplinary training which includes clinical (MD), immunology (PhD) and histopathology (British Royal College of Pathologist, Fellowship and Mmed (Pathology)).
His key research focus is to understand the resistance of cancer immunotherapy such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment by studying the interaction and function of PD-L1 with other markers and immune cells. Besides, from the technical perspective his team also aim to simple tool/technique that can easily overcome the barrier of lab technologies in order to enable every diagnostic lab in the world to perform high-end evaluation and analysis -- to deliver better clinical care. He has been recognized worldwide for automation, standardization and translation of tissue processing-imaging-analysis techniques to routine clinical diagnostic. 
He is the pioneer and KOL (>130 papers in the field, >50 first/corresponding; >100 invited talks internationally) in automation of quantitative multiplex (fluorescence-) immunohistochemistry (m-IHC), using clinical autostainers to study and quantitate tumour immune microenvironment in clinical samples. 
His works on breast cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer are included in multiple National Medical Research Council (NMRC) funded studies as well as pharmaceutical industry sponsored projects (secured >16 Million dollars research fund since 2017). He is a member of the British Royal College of Pathologist (associateship), United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Singaporean Society for immunology and Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer. His key vision is to bridge between immunologists and pathologists to better harness the advances of immunotherapy and further beyond. He is one of the winners of the Best Mentor award of NUS Wong Hock Boon Research Society in 2017 for his dedication to mentor medical student on translational research. So far he has supervised 5 postgrad students’ and >30 medical students’ research projects. One of the postdoc he trained, Dr. LAU mai chan become independent PI in 2022; One of the research officer he trained, Craig Joseph become independent Platform lead in 2024.
In 2019, he co-founded a global taskforce on multiplex IHC/IF called JEDIs (Joint Effort to Development multiplex IF/IHC standards) which include >30 multi-disciplinary (oncologist, pathologist, computer scientist, medical technologist, histologist and immunologist) team members in the world the works are featured in THE PATHOLOGIST and SITC.
He also served as a committee member in the World Immunotherapy Council (WIC) Society and Pathology Committee of Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) and is one of the organizers for its 2019 & 2023 WIC Young Investigator Symposium as well as multiplex IF expert consensus meeting 2022. He also holds editorial roles of Nature Spinger (Scientific Report), Elsevier (Immunoinformatics), SLAS Technology (Journal), Frontiers, Pathogens and World Scientific. He also serves as Program Chair of one of the largest AI medical Imaging conferences, CLINICCAI-MICCAI.  He serves as a Theme PI (Immunology) of the National Lung Cancer program funded by MOH, NMRC, Secretary (Executive) in Singapore Society of Oncology – Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium, Co-lead in Education/Diagnostic of Singhealth Duke-NUS Cell Therapy Centre as well as Advisor (Spatial Technology), Cancer Discovery Hub, National Cancer Centre.
In 2023, he co-founded World Immunotherapy Council (WIC) Asian Chapter for promoting tumor immunology and advancing cancer immunotherapy education, information and research across Asia. Subsequently, in 2025, WIC Asian chapter expanded to become APAC (Asia Pacific).
